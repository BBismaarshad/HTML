    <p>This is another paragraph.</p>

        A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.  -->

        This paragraph

<!-- The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.

The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page -->

<!-- <hr> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag. -->


<!-- HTML Line Breaks -->


<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>

<!-- The HTML <br> element defines a line break.

Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph. -->

<!-- Solution - The HTML <pre> Element -->
    <pre>
        My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
      
        My Bonnie lies over the sea.
      
        My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
      
        Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
      </pre>

      <!-- The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks. -->
